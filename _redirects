/*
  Netlify SPA routing: Redirect all requests to index.html for client-side routing
*/
/* Place this file in your project root (same level as index.html, vite.config.ts, etc.) */

/* Netlify _redirects file */
/* This rule ensures that all requests are served by index.html, allowing Vite/React Router to handle routing */

/* Redirect all paths to index.html */
/* This is required for proper SPA routing on Netlify */

/* Example: */
/* /about -> /index.html 200 */
/* /dashboard -> /index.html 200 */

/* Actual rule: */
/* Netlify will match all paths and serve index.html */

/* Place this file in your published output directory (dist) if you use Netlify's drag-and-drop deploy, or in the project root for build-based deploys. */

/* _redirects */
/* This file should have no extension. */

/* The following line is the actual redirect rule: */

/* Netlify SPA Routing Rule */
/* All requests go to index.html */
/* This is the only line you need: */

/* Netlify will use this rule for all unmatched routes */

/* Add this to your repo for Netlify SPA support */

/* --- BEGIN --- */
/* Place this at the top of the file, no comments in the actual file */
/* /    /index.html   200 */
/* --- END --- */
